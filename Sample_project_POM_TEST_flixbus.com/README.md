# Sample POM Project with Selenium and Python.

Sample Page Object Model demo test (with www.flixbus.com. as an example). This project delivers a framework for website test automation.


You can easily create a new test changing:
- sequence of actions
- amount of actions
- data provided
- expected results

However please remember about the search logic in the UI of the website.

## Requirements:
•	Python 3.8.

•	Selenium 3.141.0.

•	Webdriver for browser you would like to use.

•	html-testRunner 1.2.1.

•	JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition 2020.2.3.

## Installing:
•	Python installation package can be download from here - remember to choose option "Add to PATH" during installation.

•	Instructions for Selenium and Webdriver configuration are here - I recommend adding Selenium and Webdriver files to Python installation folder, otherwise PATH variable has to be set also for them.

•	html-testRunner can be installed by simple command in cmd: 'pip install html-testRunner'.

•	PyCharm is available here.

## Running:
I've uploaded  whole project with it's internal structure. You can simply put it into your PyCharm's PycharmProjects folder or wherever you want.
Steps to run:

1.	Open Pycharm and the project python files.
2.	Right-click on file main.py.
3.	Click on "Run ‘main’" or "Debug ’main’".
4.	When the process is finished, open Reports folder created on your computer (where the project is placed) and find an appropriate report. You can easily open this report (html document) using your web browser.
