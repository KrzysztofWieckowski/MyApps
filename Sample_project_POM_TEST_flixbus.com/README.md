# Sample POM Project with Selenium and Python.

This project delivers a framework for website test automation. It's a Sample Page Object Model demo test (with www.flixbus.com. as an example). 


You can easy create a new test changing:
- sequence of actions
- amount of actions
- data provided
- expected results

However please remember about the search logic in the UI of the website.
